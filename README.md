# TensorFlow Lite Object Detection Android Demo with Audio

### Overview

This is a camera app that continuously detects the objects (bounding boxes and
classes) in the frames seen by your device's back camera, using a quantized
[MobileNet SSD](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection)
model trained on the [COCO dataset](http://cocodataset.org/). and added voice output.

We have adopted original (https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection) android
version then added speechtotext api with application

## Build the demo using Android Studio

### Prerequisites

*   If you don't have already, install
    **[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)**,
    following the instructions on the website.

*   You need an Android device and Android development environment with minimum
    API 21.

*   Android Studio 3.2 or later.

### Building

*   Open Android Studio, and from the Welcome screen, select Open an existing
    Android Studio project.

*   From the Open File or Project window that appears, navigate to and select
    the tensorflow-lite/examples/object_detection/android directory from
    wherever you cloned the TensorFlow Lite sample GitHub repo. Click OK.

*   If it asks you to do a Gradle Sync, click OK.

*   You may also need to install various platforms and tools, if you get errors
    like "Failed to find target with hash string 'android-21'" and similar.
    Click the `Run` button (the green arrow) or select `Run > Run 'android'`
    from the top menu. You may need to rebuild the project using `Build >
    Rebuild` Project.

*   If it asks you to use Instant Run, click Proceed Without Instant Run.

*   Also, you need to have an Android device plugged in with developer options
    enabled at this point. See
    **[here](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device)** for more details
    on setting up developer devices.

#### Switch between inference solutions (Task library vs TFLite Interpreter)

This object detection Android reference app demonstrates two implementation
solutions:

(1)
[`lib_task_api`](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/nl_classification/android/lib_task_api)
that leverages the out-of-box API from the
[TensorFlow Lite Task Library](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/inference_with_metadata/task_library/object_detector);

(2)
[`lib_interpreter`](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/text_classification/android/lib_interpreter)
that creates the custom inference pipleline using the
[TensorFlow Lite Interpreter Java API](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/inference#load_and_run_a_model_in_java).

The [`build.gradle`](app/build.gradle) inside `app` folder shows how to change
`flavorDimensions "tfliteInference"` to switch between the two solutions.

Inside **Android Studio**, you can change the build variant to whichever one you
want to build and runâ€”just go to `Build > Select Build Variant` and select one
from the drop-down menu. See
[configure product flavors in Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/build-variants#product-flavors)
for more details.

For gradle CLI, running `./gradlew build` can create APKs for both solutions
under `app/build/outputs/apk`.

*Note: If you simply want the out-of-box API to run the app, we recommend
`lib_task_api` for inference. If you want to customize your own models and
control the detail of inputs and outputs, it might be easier to adapt your model
inputs and outputs by using `lib_interpreter`.*

### Model used

Downloading, extraction and placing it in assets folder has been managed
automatically by download.gradle.

If you explicitly want to download the model, you can download from
**[here](http://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/models/tflite/coco_ssd_mobilenet_v1_1.0_quant_2018_06_29.zip)**.
Extract the zip to get the .tflite and label file.
